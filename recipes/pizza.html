      You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful
      step with many kinds of dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. Instead, rub
      your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. This will
      prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color.
